                An introduction of the project, that tells what lead us to the
                opportunity to start it. Write about why it is a huge thing that
                we could start working on it, and why it is important to us,
                personally. Then we can mention other exciting features of the
                project or whatsoever. But what's the point of writing this doc
                down? This text is just a template for the actual
                projects/hobbies that obviously will be modified to suit the
                needs of the very project/hobby.
